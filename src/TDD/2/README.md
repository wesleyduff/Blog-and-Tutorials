# Start with a failing test
In this module we are going to setup our code to provide us our first failing test, then we will write code to make it pass.  
Our test will first check to make sure our module can be loaded.

Many times I find my self with an error because I did not setup my module correctly. This test should be the first test you write for any new file that gets required (imported).
