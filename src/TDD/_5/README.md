# Intermdiate TDD
In this session, I am going to add more fail and passing tests per set. 

The basics have been laid out now it is time to see how we can manage test cases that require a little more than basic testing.

## Folder 1
- Make sure a method returns what we exepect with the Chai expect library

## Folder 2 
- Use a *spy* to verify our method has been called at least once.
- Use a *spy* to verify our method was called with the correct parameters.
- Make sure our method returns data so we can write tests for low level integration tests
- Mock out third party api calls with nock
- Make sure we cover our failure cases are correct when our API returns bad or failed data

## Folder 3
- Add basic C.R.U.D. functionality to a mocked out Mongo database 
- Add test cases to validate our methods return expected successful and unsuccessful cases
